			<h3>Introduction: </h3>
			<p1>Hello and welcome to my little page! I'm Lindsay Miller and today we're going to take a dive into my previous work history, experiences, and plans for the future. I have enjoyed a variety of work expierences and personal creative goals over the last 13 years. I've has found purpose and joy in teaching, office administration, retail, marketing, security and event coordination.
			I have continued to persue personal passions in art through my continued involvement with the Seattle Art Museum and continued personal art practice. Recently I've has taken steps to learn UI/UX Design and front end programming. </p1>

			<h3>Purpose:</h3>			
			<p2> The purpose of this page is to show just a few basics of what have been learned over the last 6 months. Is this site impressive? No. Was it created from the ground up to showcase that I'm willing to take the steps needed to learn the details of HTML & CSS (and the many other languages and programs needed to be a developer)? Yes. This page was created on just notepad and published through github (though I did grab a setup feedback from just to save time). While I have found my favorite IDEs to be VS Code and Codepen, my favorite program to be Figma, and my favorite language to be Python, my favorite "non-langugage" to be HTML/CSS, this very simple page was made to show the absolute basics and to make this presentation, hopefully, a little more engaging. This has been a large step in a new and exciting direciton and I'm looking forward to continuing my education in new languages and in new programs.  </p2>

			<h3>Intention:</h3>
			<p3> Throughout my life I have been surrounded by engineers, programmers, and computers. My initial dive into the art world was a rebelious step away computer sciences and towards the liberal arts. However, today, these are by no means seperate worlds. I was dirven to persue programming to better understand those around me and to find how to bring my own creativity and passion to digital projects.</p3>
